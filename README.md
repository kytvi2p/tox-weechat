Installation
------------
> Tox-WeeChat is available in the [AUR][4] and the [[haavard]][5] pacman repository.

Tox-WeeChat requires [WeeChat][2] >= 1.0.1, [SQLite][6] >= 3.6.19 and the latest-ish [libtoxcore][7]. It also requires CMake to be built. Installation is fairly simple; after getting the source, compile and install using CMake:

    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -DPLUGIN_PATH=~/.weechat/plugins ..
    $ make install

This installs the plugin binary `tox.so` to the recommended location `~/.weechat/plugins`. The default location is `/usr/local/lib/weechat/plugins`.

Usage
-----
 - If the plugin does not load automatically, load it with `/plugin load tox`. You may have to specify the full path to the plugin binary.
 - Create a new profile with `/tox create <profile name>`. The data file is stored in `~/.weechat/tox/` by default.
 - Load your profile and connect to the Tox network with `/tox load <profile name>`.
 - Run `/help -listfull tox` to get a list of all available commands, and `/set tox.*` for a list of options.

### Common issues

#### Long Tox names messing up WeeChat layout
Tox allows names up to 128 bytes long. To prevent long names from taking all your screen space, you can set the following options in WeeChat:
 - `weechat.bar.nicklist.size_max`
 - `weechat.look.prefix_align_max`
 - `buffers.look.name_size_max` (if using buffers.pl)

#### Tox won't connect through my proxy
Make sure the address and port is correct, and that UDP is disabled (`/set tox.profile.*.udp`).
